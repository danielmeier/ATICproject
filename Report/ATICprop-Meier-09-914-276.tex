% Notes on hyperref:

% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b 
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.

\usepackage{epstopdf}


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}

This project presents a robust control approach in order to stabilize a radio controlled car on two wheels. Figure \ref{figure:arab_driving} shows this driving mode with a real car. A car on two wheels is an unstable system comparable to an inverted pendulum and therefore needs to be actively controlled. Due to many sources of uncertainty a robust controller is desirable.

\section{Introduction}

The R/C car which will be modelled is a HPI Sprint, as depicted in Figure \ref{figure:hpi_sprint}. Its length is about 430mm with a weight of about 1.2kg. The resulting nonlinear system is unstable. There is one equilibrium point which is dependant on the weight distribution of the car (center of gravity).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pics/hpisprintgeom.pdf} 
  \caption{HPI Sprint}  
  \label{figure:hpi_sprint}
\end{figure}

The controller has in- \& outputs as depicted in figure \ref{figure:controlinout}. As shown in \cite{bib:arndt}, a similar system can be controlled in a SISO matter. However, since there are cross-couplings, a MIMO approach would promise better performance.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|}
\hline
 		& Input 		& Output\\
\hline
SISO 	& Turning rate $\dot{\psi}$ 	& Steering angle $\alpha$\\
\hline
%MIMO 	& Turning rate $\dot{\psi}$ 	& Steering angle $\alpha$\\
%     	& Speed v 		& Acceleration\\
%\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{In- and outputs of the control systems}  
\label{figure:controlinout}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{Prior Work}

Arndt \cite{bib:arndt} presented an approach to control a car on two wheels however not with an optimal controller. Moreover, their car has significantly bigger tires, more inertia and a higher center of gravity which facilitates control. Liu \cite{bib:liu} developed a PID approach to control a car driving on two wheels.

\section{Dynamic System Model}

The system model is set up as depicted in Figure \ref{figure:P_car}. It consists of the steering mechanism, the roll angle dependant mapping of the steering angle and the vehicle body dynamics.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{pics/P_car.png} 
  \caption{Normalized plant}  
  \label{figure:P_car}
\end{figure}

As normalization factors, a steering angle $\alpha_{0}=10°$ and a roll angle $\rho_{0}=10°$ is chosen.


\subsection{Modelling Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Constant velocity. Dynamics of motor are slower.
    \item Coriolis force is neglected, since it small for small steering angles.
    \item Tires have infinite grip and follow exactly the steering direction.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Steering}

The \textsc{front steering} is modelled as a second order system as described by equation \ref{eq:steering}. $\alpha _{desired}$ is the systems control input, $\omega$ and $\zeta$ are chosen to match the dynamics as realistic as possible.

\begin{equation}
\frac{{{d^2}}}{{d{t^2}}}\alpha  =  - 2\zeta \omega \dot \alpha  - {\omega ^2}\left( {\alpha  - {\alpha _{desired}}} \right)
\label{eq:steering}
\end{equation}

To get the effective steering angle $\beta$, a nonlinear mapping is required. It is depicted by Figure \ref{figure:angle_plot} and implemented in the block \textsc{Angle Mapping}. It can be seen, that steering inputs lead to high effective angles when operating at a high roll angle.

%\begin{figure}[Hhh]
%\centering
%  \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pics/car_roll.eps} 
%  \caption{Car with a non-zero roll angle. The effective steering angle $\beta$ is different to the steering angle $\alpha$}

%\end{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{pics/angle_plot.eps} 
  \caption{Angle mapping: Steering angle $\alpha$ vs. effective steering angle $\beta$}  
  \label{figure:angle_plot}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Body dynamics}

The vehicle is modelled as depicted in Figure \ref{figure:geometry}. The operating point is chosen as $\dot{\Psi} = \dot{\rho} = \dot{\alpha} = 0$

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{pics/weights.eps} 
  \caption{Two-wheeled driving in a real car}  
  \label{figure:arab_driving}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
{W_{rho}} = 0.05
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{W_{rho,noise}} = 0.05
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{W_{rho,disturbance}} = \frac{{2.5}}{{5 \cdot s + 1}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{W_{rho,performace}} = \frac{{10}}{{10 \cdot s + 1}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{W_{alpha,performance}} = \frac{{0.04 \cdot \left( {1 + 0.4 \cdot s} \right)}}{{100 + 0.1 \cdot s}}
\end{equation}



Potential sources for uncertainty comprise:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry: Inertia tensor and mass. The weight distribution for instance determines the equilibrium point $\bar{\beta}$
    \item Steering: The effect of the steering angle is dependent on the vehicles tilt angle $\beta$ and nonlinear. Uncertainties can cause significant error
    \item Contact model for wheel - ground interaction
    \item Engine behaviour
    \item External disturbances such as wind
\end{itemize}
